## I'm a developer advocate at Salesforce

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm **Mohith Shrivastava**, a Principal Developer Advocate at Salesforce with over a decade of experience in building enterprise-scale products on the Salesforce Platform. My journey has been dedicated to empowering developers and enhancing the Salesforce ecosystem through innovative solutions and thought leadership.

**AI Contributions:**

- **Agentforce Custom Actions:** I've delved into the intricacies of Agentforce, Salesforce's autonomous AI platform that enables the creation of intelligent agents to support employees and customers across various channels. By leveraging flows, Apex, and prompt templates, I've demonstrated how developers can craft custom actions to boost productivity and user [interaction](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2024/03/build-custom-copilot-actions-using-apex).

- **Agentforce for Developers:** I played a pivotal role in the general availability of [Agentforce for Developers](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2024/09/introducing-agentforce-for-developers), a suite of AI-powered tools that assist developers in writing Salesforce-specific code. Powered by Salesforce's proprietary large language models, Agentforce simplifies complex development tasks, automates tedious work, and guides developers in building applications and agents efficiently.

- **Models API and Einstein Trust Layer:** I've emphasized the significance of Salesforce's Models API, which provides developers with the flexibility to build next-generation AI applications using prompt engineering and large language models. The Einstein Trust Layer ensures zero data retention with LLM providers while offering critical features like bias and toxicity scoring, streamlining the development process.

**Community Engagement:**

- **Salesforce Stack Exchange:** As one of the lead contributors, I actively engage with the developer community, providing insights and solutions to complex challenges.

- **Publications:** I've authored books like "Learning Salesforce Lightning Application Development" and "Learning Salesforce Einstein," aiming to educate and inspire developers worldwide.

- **Speaking Engagements:** I frequently speak at events, such as the AI + Data Community Tour in Toronto, where I discuss building the next generation of apps with the Einstein 1 Platform.

**Research and Thought Leadership:**

My research interests include Salesforce Development, Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, Apex, and Lightning Web Components. My work has been cited in various [scholarly](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tJ0L4DcAAAAJ&hl=en) articles, reflecting my commitment to advancing the field.

I'm passionate about inspiring and nurturing Salesforce developers, and I continuously strive to push the boundaries of what's possible on the platform. Let's connect and build the future of enterprise applications together!
